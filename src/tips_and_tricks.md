# Tips and Tricks 


## TypeScript support

How to get autocompletion for window.webxdc api in your IDE via TypeScript.

### Get the TypeScript Definitions

Just copy [`webxdc.d.ts`](https://github.com/webxdc/webxdc_docs/blob/master/webxdc.d.ts) into your source dir:

```typescript
{{#include ../webxdc.d.ts:3:}}
```

you can find it also on <https://github.com/webxdc/webxdc_docs/blob/master/webxdc.d.ts> or just copy the code block above.

> In the future this might become an @types npm module, but for now it is what it is: _a simple file copy with **no** automatic updates_.

### Using types

Start by importing the file.

In TypeScript: 

```typescript
import type { Webxdc } from './webxdc.d.ts'
```

In JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {import('./webxdc').Webxdc} Webxdc
 */
```

This works in VS Code nicely together with the `//@ts-check` comment on top of your source file.

If you want you can also type your own functions using [JSDoc comments](https://jsdoc.app/).

> If you don't use VS Code you can still make use of the type checking with the TypeScript compiler:
>
> ```sh
> npm i -g typescript # -g stands for global installation
> tsc --noEmit --allowJs --lib es2015,dom *.js
> ```

### Own Payload Type

If you have a type for your state update **payloads**, replace the `any` in `Webxdc<any>` with your own payload type:

```typescript
{{#include ../webxdc.d.ts:global}}
```


## Transpile Newer JavaScript With Babel.js

Older devices might not have the newest javascript features/syntax in their webview, you may want to transpile your code down to an older JavaScript version eg. with [Babel](https://babeljs.io).

Targets:

- Desktop (electron -> is chrome 91)
- iOS (iOS 11 -> webkit 604.1.38)
- android (android 5 -> the webview system component can be updated by the user: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview>)

If you want to use a newer API make sure to check on <https://caniuse.com>. If you just want to use newer JavaScript syntax, babel.js is the right tool for you - it translates new JS into older JS, that can be interpreted.



## Debugging With eruda.js

When you can not use [debugging inside Delta Chat](#debugging-inside-delta-chat), 
either because you have no computer to connect to or if you are on iOS, 
you may try [eruda.js](https://github.com/liriliri/eruda) 
as an alternative to browser-native debugging tools.

1. Download a [standalone eruda.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eruda@3.0.1/eruda.js) 

1. Copy `eruda.js` next to your `index.html` 

1. Prepend the following snippet to the head section of your index.html: 

    ```html
    <script src="eruda.js"></script>
    <script>
      eruda.init();
    </script>
    ```

When your webxdc app is started, 
a floating button will appear in a corner. 
Tap it to see the developer tools.

## Debugging Inside Delta Chat

### Debug a webxdc app in Android via Chrome DevTools

1. enable webView debugging in delta chat settings 
   `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Developer Mode`: 
   <img alt="image of andvanced screen" src="images/android_remote_debug_enable.png" style="max-height:40vh" />

1. enable developer mode and ADB debugging on your device 
   _(go to system settings, device info, click 7+ times on build number 
   until there is a toast telling you that you are now a "Developer", 
   then go into the new developer menu and enable "ADB debugging", 
   see also [android docs: Enable ADB debugging on your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling))._

1. connect your device via USB to your computer

1. open chromium (or google chrome) and go to `chrome://inspect/#devices`

1. start your webxdc that you want to debug

1. click on `inspect`:

<p>
<img
src="images/android_remote_debug_list.png"
alt="screenshot of chrome dev tools device list"
style="max-height:40vh"
/>
</p>

| Inpect HTML                                                      | JavaScript Console                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![dev tools inpector](images/android_remote_debug_inspector.png) | ![dev tools js console](images/android_remote_debug_console.png) |

> Make sure to **disable adb debugging again** after you are done with debugging!


### Debug a webxdc app in Delta Chat Desktop

First enable the devTools for webxdc in the Settings:

  `Settings` > `Advanced` > Experimental Features > `Enable Webxdc Devtools`

> Note that you need to close and open any active webxdcs again for changes to take effect

Start the webxdc you want to debug and press `F12` to open the developer tools:

<p>
<img
src="images/desktop_debug_open.png"
alt="screenshot of desktop webxdc window with devtool"
style="max-height:40vh"
/>
</p>

A bit small isn't it? fix it either by resizing the window's **width** or **undock** the developer tools:

<p>
<img
src="images/desktop_debug_undock.png"
alt="undock devtools"
style="max-height:40vh"
/>
</p>

<p>
<img
src="images/desktop_debug_extra_window.png"
alt="undock devtools"
style="max-height:40vh"
/>
</p>



## Optimizing Your App Icon

There are several things you can do to shrink down the size of your icon:

- save without thumbnail image (in gimp it can be done in the export dialog)
- shrink the image resolution (`256px` are enough, in some cases `128px` or even lower like `64px` can sufice)
- change your PNG colors from `RGB` to `Indexed` (in gimp `Image` -> `Mode` -> `Indexed`, see <https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-convert-indexed.html>)


> For `png` you can also use the `oxipng` tool (<https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng>), which automagically optimizes your icon's file size without quality loss:
> ```
> oxipng icon.png -s -o max
> ```
> 
> If you have png files in your project, you should also do this them to safe even more bytes.
>
> Noteworthy parameters:
> - `--pretend` only calculates gains
> - `-Z` even more compression, but takes longer
> - for more info see `oxipng --help`# Troubleshooting


## I Cannot Share Variables on iOS Between Scripts!

Your code:

`a.js`

```js
const CONFIG = { difficulty: "hard", hasCoins: true };
```

`b.js`

```js
if (CONFIG.difficulty == "hard") {
  /** make the game harder **/
}
```

`index.html`

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="a.js"></script>
    <script src="b.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Basically you get many errors in your JS console like this:

```
Can't find variable: CONFIG
```

There are a few ways to solve this:

- use a bundle to bundle all your JS to one file (some bundlers: parcel, webpack, esbuild)
- use esm modules (see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules>)
- define your variables as inline script in your HTML file. (inline script means that the script is in the HTML file between the `<script>` tags: `<script>my code</script>`)
- append your global variables to the window object: `window.myVar = 1;` and use them like `console.log(window.myVar)`
